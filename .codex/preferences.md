# Codex Preferences

## Response Style
- **Be concise and brief** - token limit is 5 hours/week
- **No unnecessary .md documentation files**
- **Only create files when explicitly asked**
- **Focus on code, not documentation**
- **Skip verbose explanations** - just the essentials

## When to Create Files
- Don't auto-create: AUDIT_REPORT.md, SUMMARY.md, FIXES_APPLIED.md, etc.
- Only create files when user explicitly requests them
- For multi-file changes, just briefly list what changed

## Todo Lists
- Skip TodoWrite for simple tasks
- Only use for complex multi-step work (5+ tasks)

## Code Changes
- Make fixes directly when requested
- Provide brief summary after changes
- Don't create documentation about what was changed

## Reading Files
- Read only necessary files
- Use specific line ranges when possible
- Avoid broad "check everything" explorations

## General
- User often hits token limits - conserve tokens aggressively
- Quality over quantity
- Action over documentation

# Pipeline.md
- update Pipeline.md every time.
